# robot-kinematics

This package helps us to calculate the forward kinematic of a robot. 
There are several advantages of using the package over RobotToolkit package: 1- The kinematic chain of the robot is defined inside the code, which means that we don't need to change any .xml file. Second, the Jacobian matrix for the rotation matrix can be calculated.

There are two examples in the packages, one of them might not work properly. Furthermore, another example is "inverse-kinematics-examples" package, which works perfectly.
